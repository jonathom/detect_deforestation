# Near Real-Time Monitoring of Deforestation using Optical Remote Sensing Data

# Introduction

Forests are known to be crucial  part of the ecosystem . They purify water and air . Forests  are key in mitigating climate changes  as the act as carbon sink and apart from that there are varieties of land-based species that live in the forest. Forests in the tropical are under threat due to deforestation .Deforestation in this context refers  to (UNFCCC 2001) definition which is the direct human-induced conversion of forested land to do non-forested land.

In this research we  focused on Brazil Amazonia because deforestation that occurs in that region leads to loss of environmental services that affect the whole world therefore affecting Brazil the most (Fearnside, 1997a, 2008a).  Environmental services of Amazonian forest here include its roles in storing carbon, which avoids global warming (Fearnside, 2000, 2016a; Nogueira et al., 2015), recycling of water in also non-Amazonian areas (Arraut et al., 2012), and in maintenance of biodiversity (Fearnside, 1999). Additionally, Amazonian forests provide a variety of material products, like rubber and Brazil nuts; which currently support local populations and are also lost as opportunities for sustainable use  when areas are deforested. 

Carrying out near-real time monitoring of deforestation can help to curb the menace. Satellite sensors Are greatly capable for this task because they provide repeatable measurements that are consistent in both spatial scale and temporal scale. This capability enables capturing of many processes that can  cause change including natural cases like fire and anthropogenic disturbances like deforestation (Jin and Sader, 2005).

Our research focused on utilizing Optical Multi-spectral Remote Sensing Imagery to carry out near real time monitoring of deforestation. The main challenge of optical satellite data specifically on the tropics is that they cannot penetrate cloud cover. We therefore explored new techniques such as a gapfill algorithm to  predict missing values in  optical imagery time series data, we also explored the capability of bfastmonitor to detect near real-time disturbance in a time series optical datasets that have undergone gapfilling process.

# Methods

The time series Landsat 8 satellite images used for this research were already provided in a state where cloud cover were already removed. The data covers the period 01-01-2013 to 31-12-2019. 
The Landsat 8 data covered row 001, paths 066 and 067.

The time series data was aggregated to a monthly and quarterly NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) data where the median pixel values per row and column were selected. This resulted to 12 NDVI images per year in the former approach and 4 NDVI images per year in the latter approach


Prediction of missing values in satellite data are carried out using gapfill package in R . The gapfill approach was designed to carry out predictions on satellite data that  were recorded at equally spaced points of time.  Based on Gerber et.al 2016 , they applied the algorithm to MODIS NDVI data with cloud cover scenarios of 50% missing data. The method was further compared to Gapfill-Python and TIMESAT  and it provided the most accurate prediction in terms of RMSE.

Gapfill was appealing to this research because it's capable of handling large spatio-temporal data, itâ€™s user friendly and capability tailored to  specific features of different satellite images. The predictions of the missing values are based on a subset-predict procedure, i.e., each missing value is predicted separately by (1) selecting subsets of the data that are in a neighborhood around the missing point and (2) predicting the missing value based on the subset(Gerber, 2016).

In this research we also explored to tailor gapfill by customizing the iMax parameter which is the maximum number of iterations until NA is  returned as predicted value (Gerber, 2016). The research  compares the iMax parameter at value 5 (five)  for  five iterations versus undefined which results to infinite iterations by default.

## Input Data and Preparations

* Package description
* PRODES data sorted by years can be found here: [PRODES yearly deforestation](http://terrabrasilis.dpi.inpe.br/download/dataset/legal-amz-prodes/vector/yearly_deforestation.zip)

As seen in "final.Rmd". The subdirectory `L8cube_subregion` contains a NDVI time series as single `.tif` files, a file per acquisition, as input data.
```{r load-data, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.show="hold", out.width="50%"}
library(stars)
library(gapfill)
library(bfast)
library(zoo)
library(raster)
subdir = "landsat_monthly"
f = paste0(subdir, "/", list.files(subdir))
st = merge(read_stars(f)) # make stars object
plot(st)
subdir = "landsat_quarterly"
f = paste0(subdir, "/", list.files(subdir))
st_q = merge(read_stars(f)) # make stars object
plot(st_q)
```

```{r crop-prodes, eval=FALSE}
# load PRODES data
prod <- read_sf("./yearly_deforestation/yearly_deforestation.shp")
prod_3857 <- st_make_valid(st_transform(prod, crs = st_crs(st)))
prod_crop <- st_crop(prod_3857, st) # clip
write_sf(prod_crop, "./yearly_deforestation/PRODES_cropped.shp", overwrite = TRUE)
```

```{r load-prodes}
prod <- read_sf("./yearly_deforestation/PRODES_cropped.shp")
# prod <- prod[prod$YEAR < 2019,]
```

```{r plot-AOI, warning=FALSE}
# whats in it?
# plot(st)
plot(prod["YEAR"], axes = TRUE, main = "PRODES Deforestation Data Colored by Year")
```

## Prepare for Gapfill

`Gapfill` documentation tells us that as input, a 4-dimensional numeric array is needed, with dimensions x, y, seasonal index (doy), year.
```{r create-gapfill-input}
prep_gapfill <- function(st, doy, ts) {
  # st is stars object, doy is day of year vector, ts is number of timesteps per year
  
  # get pixels of whole dataset
  imgdata <- c(st[,,,][[1]])

  # make labels
  xlab <- seq(from = attr(st, "dimensions")[[1]]$offset, by = attr(st, "dimensions")[[1]]$delta, length.out = attr(st, "dimensions")[[1]]$to)
  ylab <- seq(from = attr(st, "dimensions")[[2]]$offset, by = attr(st, "dimensions")[[2]]$delta, length.out = attr(st, "dimensions")[[2]]$to)
  years <- seq(2013,2019,1)

  # make array, transpose
  h <- array(imgdata, dim = c(140, 140, ts, 7), dimnames = list(xlab, ylab, doy, years))
  # x, y is switched between stars and these arrays
  h <- aperm(h, c(2,1,3,4))
  return(h)
}

doy_12 <- c(1, 32, 60, 91, 121, 152, 182, 213, 244, 274, 305, 335)
doy_4 <- c(1, 91, 182, 274)

ma_monthly <- prep_gapfill(st, doy_12, 12)
ma_quarter <- prep_gapfill(st_q, doy_4, 4)
```

## Gapfill

```{r do-gapfill, warning=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
d <- Gapfill(ma_monthly, iMax = 5)
saveRDS(d, "./monthly_iMax5_140_gapfilled.rds")
e <- Gapfill(ma_quarter, iMax = 5)
saveRDS(e, "./quarterly_iMax5_140_gapfilled.rds")
f <- Gapfill(ma_quarter) # iMax defaults to infinite
saveRDS(f, "./quarterly_iMaxInf_140_gapfilled.rds")
```

### Gapfill Results

## Calculate BFAST Over AOI

```{r bfast-aoi, warning=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
bfast_on_tile <- function(gapfill_matrix, by, ts, order) {
  dims <- dim(gapfill_matrix)
  result <- matrix(rep(FALSE, dims[1]*dims[2]), ncol = dims[1])
  for (i in 1:dims[1]) { # looping through x
    for (j in 1:dims[2]) { # loops through y
      raw_px_ts <- as.vector(gapfill_matrix[i,j,,]) # create pixel timeseries vector
      px_ts_obj <- as.ts(zoo(raw_px_ts, seq(2013, by = by, length.out = ts))) # make into ts object
      bfm_obj <- bfastmonitor(px_ts_obj, start = 2019, order = order) # bfastmonitor of pixel timeseries
      brkpoint <- bfm_obj$breakpoint
      if(!is.na(brkpoint)) { # if breakpoint is available..
        result[i,j] <- TRUE # .. write TRUE to solution raster
      } else {
        # FALSE
      }
    }
  }
  return(result)
}

bfast_monthly3 <- bfast_on_tile(gf_monthly$fill, by = .08333333, ts = 84, order = 3)
bfast_monthly2 <- bfast_on_tile(gf_monthly$fill, by = .08333333, ts = 84, order = 2)
bfast_quarter2 <- bfast_on_tile(gf_quarterly$fill, by = 0.25, ts = 28, order = 2)
# order = 2 was chosen because order 3 doesn't work on our quarterly aggreggated data
saveRDS(bfast_monthly2, "bfast_monthly2.rds")
saveRDS(bfast_quarter2, "bfast_quarter2.rds")
# warning: too few observations in history period
```

```{r load-bfast-tiles}
bfast_monthly <- readRDS("bfast_monthly2.rds")
bfast_quarter <- readRDS("bfast_quarter2.rds")
```

prodes[prodes < 2019] <- FALSE
prodes[prodes == 2019] <- TRUE
prodes[is.na(prodes)] <- FALSE

# to mask out previous deforestation
# <2019 = TRUE, !<2019 = FALSE
prodes_prev <- aperm(matrix(ras[], ncol = 140), c(2,1))
prodes_prev[prodes_prev < 2019] <- TRUE
prodes_prev[prodes_prev == 2019] <- FALSE
prodes_prev[is.na(prodes_prev)] <- FALSE

bfast_monthly[prodes_prev == 1] <- FALSE

bfast_quarter[prodes_prev == 1] <- FALSE

  kappa <- (P0 - Pe) / (1 - Pe)
  
  return(list("Overall Accuracy" = P0*100, "Prod. Acc. FALSE" = pa_f*100, "Prod. Acc. TRUE" = pa_t*100, "User's Acc. FALSE" = ua_f*100, "User's Acc. TRUE" = ua_t*100, "Kappa" = kappa))
